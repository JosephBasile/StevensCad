The purpose of StevensGameLib is to create a single library that is easy to use
and that provides useful utility functions in constructing OpenGL programs using
modern shaders.

We provide the following features:

1. A single base class GLWin that encapsulates everything. A few lines will create a working OpenGL program.

2. A static library libstevensgame.a that includes all the code
3. A single input management system that supports multiple keyboards and mice and works across Windows, Linux and MacOS
4. Utility functions for animation

Status:
1. At the moment the input library is not integrated with the graphics though it works on Windows and Linux.
2. An animation system based on a single master time variable t is designed but not implemented yet.

TODO:
1. Create a class with a draw list that draws Shapes.  Base class Shape is already created but might need work.
2. Create an input mapping system that maps input events to commands, and commands to functions/methods that are executed.
3. Support a standard set of projections to make it easy to draw 2d and 3d.
4. Add font support using freetype.
