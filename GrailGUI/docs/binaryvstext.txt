1. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of human-readble text for data transmission. Explain XML which has tags around every data, and JSON.

2. Explain the difficulties with binary (not immediately obvious what any given byte means). Either the receiver must know the structure of the data, or metadata must somehow be encoded.

3. Explain the comparative efficiency of sending ASCII text to encode a number v. binary Give two examples (int and double) for the following values:

-2
-1234567890
4123567890
1.2
-1.5
-1.23456789012345
6.0231092411215e+23
1.23456789012345e+308

discuss:
fixed vs. variable size (difficult to index the nth number)
time to take binary representation and turn it into text
increased size of text

4. Describe comparative efficiency of the server or the client converting binary to text
   The server is a shared resource
   The faster it can respond, the better
   Data size is reduced
   formatting can be done in parallel with getting more data
   server needs less CPU power, reducing electricity in server farms?
   	  Is this true? The operation has to happen somewhere
